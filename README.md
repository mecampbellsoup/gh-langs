# Github Langs

Using Ruby + D3.js, provide a real-time visualization of public GitHub repo commits ***by-language***.

## Next Steps
* implement basic GitHub API client (using octokit gem, perhaps?)
* determine process for fetching, in real-time, most recent GitHub commits
* determine how to extract language(s) data from commit object
* connect my back-end API to a D3.js front-end for visualizing
